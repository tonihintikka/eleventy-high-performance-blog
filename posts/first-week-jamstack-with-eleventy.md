# First Week-Some JAMstack with eleventy.

I had to start a blog for my studies. First, I needed to look for a stack for this kind of blog. I have worked with WordPress in my professional life for five years now, and it would be the obvious choice for me.

But then I rethought this. WordPress is a huge size platform, but I need something simpler. Another reason to opt-out of WordPress is its familiarity for me.

I want to know about new technologies, and I found out JAMstack. Good starting point to know more about the issue is FreeCodeCamp's [JamStack tutorial video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_l0qrPUJds). I gladly recommend it.

I chose Netlify for my blog's running environment, and I want all my content to locate in GitHub version control. For the Static Site generator, I chose 11ty. I found out about Google's furious fast 11ty theme, so I used it as a starting point.

```text/2-3
// this is a command
function myCommand() {
	let counter = 0;
	counter++;
}

// Test with a line break above this line.
console.log('Test');
```
